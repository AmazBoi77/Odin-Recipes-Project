    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    
    To make a classic cheesecake, preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C) and prepare a graham 
    cracker crust by mixing 1 1/2 cups of crushed graham crackers, 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1/2 cup 
    of melted butter, then pressing it into the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan. In a 
    separate bowl, beat 4 packages (8 ounces each) of softened cream cheese until creamy, add 
    1 cup of sugar, mix well, then add 4 large eggs one at a time, followed by 1 teaspoon of vanilla 
    extract. Pour the filling over the crust and bake for 45-50 minutes until the edges are set but 
    the center is slightly jiggly. Turn off the oven and let it sit inside for an hour, then refrigerate 
    for at least 4 hours or overnight. Top with your favorite toppings like fruit compote or chocolate ganache 
    before serving. Enjoy your homemade cheesecake!
